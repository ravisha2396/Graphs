### Graph Theory

###### This repository consists of solutions to the problems related to graphs.

###### As you know, graphs have a wide range of applications like GPS, network packet routing, social media connections etc.

###### We will look at some popular situations that arise when we model problems into graphs and try to solve them.

###### You will get to explore some popular ways to store graphs and traverse graphs in optimal ways to best solve the problems associated with graphs.
